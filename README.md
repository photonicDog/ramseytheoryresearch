# ramseytheoryresearch
A collection of research methods and data from my dissertation on Ramsey Theory.

These are my scripts and the data generated from them during my research into Ramsey Theory, and the lower bound of R(5,5).

This includes these main algorithms (and all the data they generated):

* genetic.py, the genetic algorithm
* annealing.py, the simulated annealing algorithm
* hillclimb.py, the hill-climbing algorithm

Also included are the following utilities:
* visual.py, for visualising graphs
* check.py, for checking 5-clique counts
